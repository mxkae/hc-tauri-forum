# Holochain Kangaroo

Put your Holochain App in this Kangaroo's tauri pouch and let it run around.

This repository let's you easily convert your Holochain app into a standalone tauri-based cross-platform Desktop app.

**Holochain Version**: The Kangaroo currently comes with Holochain holochain-v0.2.7-rc.1.

**Note**: Support for non-breaking updates to happ coordinator zomes is currently not built into the kangaroo.

# Instructions

1. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (Go is required for Holochain version 0.2.X). Then follow the [Tauri Prerequisites](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) instructions for your platform.

2. Either use this repository as a template (by clicking on the green "Use this template" button) or fork it.<br>
Using it as a template allows you to start with a clean git history and the contributors of this repository won't show up as contributors to your new repository. **Forking has the advantage of being able to relatively easily pull in updates from this parent repository at a later stage.**

3. After cloning the newly created repository, run `npm install` to install the relevant tauri dependencies.

4. Compile the holochain and lair-keystore binaries if you intend to build your app locally. On macOS/Linux you can run `bash setup/install_binaries.sh` to do that automatically. On Windows, follow [this](compile-binaries.md) guide.

5. Add your `[your-project].happ` file and your `ui.zip` file to the `./pouch` folder

6. Search the repository for `replace-me` and replace it with your project's name or follow the instructions in the comments if provided. **Note:** The `productName` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` must not contain any dots or parentheses (and likely other special characters).

7. Add your app's icon: If you have an icon for your app, make sure to have it as a 1024x1024 pixel `.png` format and run `npm run tauri icon [path-to-your-1024x1024-png]` (https://tauri.app/v1/guides/features/icons). This will generate all the necessary icons and store it in `src-tauri/icons`

8. Set all the version numbers in `package.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. The verison number in `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` is part of the filesystem storage logic, **read the [note on versioning](#note-on-versioning)**

9. Build the app locally by running `npm run kangaroo`

## Publish cross-platform Binaries

To publish cross-platform binaries (not code-signed), follow these steps:

1. Create a new branch `release`: `git checkout -b release`.

2. Push the new branch to github to trigger the release workflow.

For further releases:

1. Update the version number of your app in all relevant places.

2. Merge your changes from `main` into `release`

3. Push to github to trigger the release workflow.


## Code-signed cross-platform Binaries

The `.github/workflows/release-codesigned.yaml` contains a template workflow for binaries with macOS as well as Windows EV Certificate code signing. The workflow gets triggered when publishing on branch `release-codesigned`.

The macOS code signing is based on tauri's instructions [here](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/distribution/sign-macos).

The Windows code signing with EV cert is based on [these](https://melatonin.dev/blog/how-to-code-sign-windows-installers-with-an-ev-cert-on-github-actions/) instructions and uses a slightly modified [fork](https://github.com/matthme/tauri-action-ev-signing/) of tauri's github actions.

For the Windows part or if you want to only do macOS code signing, follow the instructions in the comments in `release-codesigned.yaml` (search for the keyword `HELP`).

If you want to sign your Windows binaries with an OV certificate instead of an EV certificate, follow [tauri's instructions](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/distribution/sign-windows).


## Auto-Updating of your App

To add automatic updates to your app, you may follow the instructions [here](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/distribution/updater).
An empty `updater.json` template file is part of this repository.

Some important notes:

* The Holochain Kangaroo stores data on the filesystem according to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). See [Note on versioning](#note-on-versioning)

* If you bump your Holochain and/or lair keystore version, you need to consider whether it remains compatible with the existing Holochain conductor / lair keystore.

As a consequence, **be careful not to trigger automatic updates on your end-users if your app
is a breaking change due to one of the above mentioned scenarios**.


## Note on Versioning

The Holochain Kangaroo stores data on the filesystem according to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), for which it considers the app version specified in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. This has implications on your choice of the version number.

<pre>Example:
Binaries built with app versions 0.0.2 and 0.0.3 will store their data in separate subfolder on the filesystem and will have independent Holochain conductors. From end-user perspective this is a breaking change and opening a 0.0.3 version of your app won't provide access to data stored with the 0.0.2 version of your app.

Binaries built with app versions 0.3.2 and 0.3.4 will share the same subfolder `0.3.x` on the filesystem and will share the same Holochain conductor.

Binaries built with app versions 2.0.5 and 2.3.4 will share the same subfolder `2.x.x` on the filesystem and will share the same Holochain conductor.

Pre-releases are always stored in independent subfolders (0.1.0-alpha.1 is considered incompatible with 0.1.0-alpha.2)
</pre>

## Troubleshooting

* If you get the error `Error failed to bundle project: Failed to build data folders and files` when running `npm run tauri build`, a likely reason is that your `productName` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` contains invalid characters, such as dots (`.`)

* If building the app fails with errors like `Error: No artifacts were found.` or `Error failed to bundle project: error running light.exe` the reason may again be that the `productName` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` contains invalid characters such as parentheses (`(` or `)`) or possibly other unsupported special characters.
